﻿# Guided-project-foreach-if-array-CSharp
Starter and Solution code for the Guided project: "Develop foreach and if-elseif-else structures to process array data in C#" from the Microsoft Learn collection "Getting started with C#"

This C# console application is designed to:
- Use arrays to store student names and assignment scores.
- Use a `foreach` statement to iterate through the student names as an outer program loop.
- Use an `if` statement within the outer loop to identify the current student name and access that student's assignment scores.
- Use a `foreach` statement within the outer loop to iterate though the assignment scores array and sum the values.
- Use an algorithm within the outer loop to calculate the average exam score for each student.
- Use an `if-elseif-else` construct within the outer loop to evaluate the average exam score and assign a letter grade automatically.
- Integrate extra credit scores when calculating the student's final score and letter grade as follows:
    - detects extra credit assignments based on the number of elements in the student's scores array.
    - divides the values of extra credit assignments by 10 before adding extra credit scores to the sum of exam scores.
- use the following report format to report student grades:
                       
| Student | Grade |    |
|---------|-------|----|
| Sophia  | 92.2  | A- |
| Andrew  | 89.6  | B+ |
| Emma    | 85.6  | B  |
| Logan   | 91.2  | A- |
